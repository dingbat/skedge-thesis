In this paper I present Skedge, a web application for students to comfortably and effectively engage with the University's course catalog. Skedge matches and surpasses the capabilities of the existing University tool for this purpose, ``Course Description / Course Schedule'' (CDCS) and presents its information in a more visually appealing way. As a result, Skedge boasts strong user-retention rates, long session durations, and high student adoption despite having virtually no advertisement. Through collected usage data, I demonstrate that \textbf{a)} Skedge's differences from and additions to CDCS are usable and have real-world need, \textbf{b)} the three major use-cases associated with course browsing---direct search, exploratory search, and peer recommendation---are effectively accommodated by Skedge, and \textbf{c)} Skedge's novel search mechanism is user-friendly and self-teaches to users over time.
