\subsection{Definitions}

A navigation is defined as
a search, or
a click on an instructorâ€™s name, or
a click on a crosslisted or prerequisite course link

The navigations-per-add measure is
the number of navigations a user took (within one session) until a course was added, bookmarked

\subsection{Breaking them apart}

  behavioral patterns
  Direct search for specific course
  Discovery, browsing, exploring

  \subsubsection{Direct searches}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/graph/direct_navs}

    \caption{Etc}
    \label{fig:searchtypes}
  \end{figure}

  Why would 0-navs be so common with direct searches? 64\% of them subsections!

  \subsubsection{Browse}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/graph/browse_navs}

    \caption{Etc}
    \label{fig:searchtypes}
  \end{figure}

  As expected, the 0-navs were mostly maincourses (62\%)
