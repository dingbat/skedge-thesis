LaTeX file for my honors senior thesis at the University of Rochester, maybe the template will help someone.

Build with:
```
$ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
```
(You may have to run this a few times to get the bibliography up)

See the site [here](http://skedgeur.com), and the final thesis result [here](https://dropbox.com/s/dg0zic5376d7re4/thesis.pdf?raw=1).
