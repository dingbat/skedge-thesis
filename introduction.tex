\chapter{Introduction}

In this paper, I am proud to finally introduce the world to \emph{Skedge}, a website I have been developing in various degrees since December 9th, 2013. Skedge began as a weekend side-project for me after spending too much time frustrated with existing tools while trying to find myself a second major to pursue. It wasn't until I briefly presented it at an on-campus RocHack meeting when I realized it had potential to help other students as well, but since, it has always existed in the shadows and in continual ``beta''---unofficial, unsupported and dodging recognition. Until two summers ago, I had never expected it to end up being the subject of my honors senior thesis, so this opportunity represents a rather special privilege for me and, selfishly, an outlet for recognition.
