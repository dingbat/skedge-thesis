\chapter{Data analytics}

In this chapter I propose three hypotheses. They are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Skedge's differences from and additions to CDCS are \textbf{usable and have real need}.

  \item Skedgeâ€™s \emph{navigations-per-add} demonstrate the \textbf{effectiveness of its search features} for each of the following three user search paradigms:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item direct search,
    \item exploratory search, and
    \item peer-guided search
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{SkedgeQL is user-friendly}; users learn how to make more sophisticated search queries over time \textbf{simply by using it}.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In the following sections I will present my analysis on collected usage data since November 3rd 2015, which will serve to validate each hypothesis.
